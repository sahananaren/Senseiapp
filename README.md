Privacy Policy for Sensei

Last updated: July 25, 2025

Sensei does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.
While the app may declare certain permissions (such as access to the camera), these are not actively used or accessed by the app. These permissions may be bundled by default as part of underlying libraries or frameworks, but the app does not utilize them in any functionality.
We are committed to user privacy and data security. If this changes in future versions, this policy will be updated accordingly.
